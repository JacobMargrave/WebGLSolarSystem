# WebGLSolarSystem

Author: Patrick Chapman and Jacob Margrave

## Overview
This program represents a simulation of our solar system. It includes 9 planets,
4 dwarf planets, and 18 moons. The simulator includes camera controls that allow
the user to focus on each planet and moon. There are also controls that allow
the user to view the highlighted planet and moon orbits. Most of the planets
have included bump and specular maps that enhance the details of the planets.
The simulator takes a fairly realistic approach in representing the solar system.
For instance, planets are given relative sizes to one another and are spaced
appropriately. The program still has some minor bugs with the camera and could
use some adjustments on some minor details.

## Controls

### Camera

The camera can be rotated by holding down the left mouse button and dragging the mouse.

The GUI features controls to focus on each of the planets and moons. To select the
planet that you wish to use, click the drop down menu and click on the planet. NOTE:
In order to focus in on the planet, you must rotate the camera after you have clicked
on the planet that you wish to view.

To zoom in or out on a planet, use the mouse wheel.
NOTE: The default zoom level does not work perfectly so you may have to scroll in or out
to try and get the planet to be at a viewable distance.

### Orbit

To view the orbits of the different objects in space, click the appropriate drop down
menu and select ON. To get rid of the orbit highlights, select OFF.

### Atmosphere

NOTE: NOT ALL PLANETS HAVE THIS FEATURE!

To view the atmosphere of the appropriate planets, click the Atmospheres drop down menu
and select ON. To turn off the atmospheres for these planets, select OFF.
